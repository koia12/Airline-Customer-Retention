# Airline-Customer-Retention
## Exploratory data analysis and customer retention modeling of postgres_air database 

We want to retrieve and reshape flights data from the [postgres_air flights database](https://github.com/hettie-d/postgres_air), and model the impact of a missed flight on the length of time until the customer makes another booking. For an airline, this could give a nuanced answer not just to whether they are losing customers permanently yes or no, but if annoyed customers possibly hold off on making another booking at this airline before eventually coming back. This project consists of exploratory data analysis and retrieval in SQL and fitting the survival models in R and Stan.
